# epidemic_BRdata
A data science project that aims to collect and pre-process epidemic data from Brazilian official sources.

In the *data_acquisition* directory you will find the following Jupyter notebooks, in Python:
- **Brazilian_EpidemiologicalBulletins.ipynb**: the first strategy for data acquisition, whereas the Brazilian Ministry of Health's epidemiological bulletins are automatically downloaded and scrapped. This strategy was halted after the bulletin style has changed.  

- **Brazilian_Ministry_of_Health_COVID19data.ipynb**: the current strategy, which seeks to download the recent data made available from the Brazilian Ministry of Health.
